# Purpose of the Project :

Create a website to show off game modifications I've written in the past.
Based loosely on the readme i wrote for the debug mode code found [here](https://github.com/EonTAS/DebugMode).

# User Stories :

## Home Page :
As a visitor I want to know about what projects have been done and how to download them.

## Key Features of Debug Mode: 
As a visitor, I want to be able to know what feature are provided and what makes them cool.

## Features: 
As a visitor I want to know how completed any given feature.

## Suggestions:
As a user, I want to be able to suggest new ideas for the project or get in contact with the owner of the site. 

## Bug Reports:
As a user, I want to be able to tell the creator about any bugs i experience and how to reproduce them.

## Download: 
As a potential user I want to have an easily accessible download link at all times.

## Features Page

Original plan of a features page has been reworked to make use of an image carousel as seen below

![Image](/wireframes/FeaturesRework.png)

Has layout for 3 sizes, where largest places images inbetween textboxes instead of below them.
Has a progress bar at the bottom of the image showing how far along the given feature is in development.

## Suggestions/Bug Reports Page

# Typography and Color Scheme :

Background will be a carbon colour, relatively dark.
Text will be an off-white colour using the Exo and Roboto fonts.

### Deployment

I developed this project using [Gitpod IDE]() and a git-repo hosted on GitHub. 

The page is hosted using GitHub Pages by doing the following:

1) Log in
2) Open Repo
3) Select Settings
4) Find the GitHub Pages Section
5) select the master branch as the source
6) get link from the page again.

This page can be found [here](https://EonTas.github.io/Mods-Site/.) for the forseeable future.

## How to run locally

To clone you will need a github account or other git client.
1) Open this link to the [project](https://github.com/EonTAS/Mods-Site/)
2) Under the repo name, click "clone or download" button.
3) copy the clone url for the repository.
4) In your IDE of choice, open the terminal 
5) set working directory to where you want to clone the repo.
6) type `git clone` and paste the url from step 3 and press enter.

### Testing
