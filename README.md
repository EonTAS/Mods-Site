Based loosely on the readme i wrote for the debug mode code found [here](https://github.com/EonTAS/DebugMode).

# User Stories :

As a visitor I want to know about what projects have been done and how to download them.

## Key Features of Debug Mode: 
As a visitor, I want to be able to know what feature are provided and what makes them cool.

## Features: 
As a visitor I want to know how completed any given feature.

## Suggestions:
As a user, I want to be able to suggest new ideas for the project or get in contact with the owner of the site. 

## Bug Reports:
As a user, I want to be able to tell the creator about any bugs i experience and how to reproduce them.

## Download: 
As a potential user I want to have an easily accessible download link at all times.

## Navbar:
As a user i want to be able to navigate through the page easily on both mobile and desktop.

## Footer:

## Features Page

![Image](/wireframes/Features.png)

Original plan of a features page has been reworked to make use of an image carousel as seen below

![Image](/wireframes/FeaturesRework.png)

Has layout for 3 sizes, where largest places images inbetween textboxes instead of below them.
Has a progress bar at the bottom of the image showing how far along the given feature is in development.

## Suggestions/Bug Reports Page

# Typography and Color Scheme :

Background will be a carbon colour, relatively dark.
Text will be an off-white colour using the Exo and Roboto fonts.

### Deployment

I developed this project using [Gitpod IDE](https://gitpod.io/) and a git-repo hosted on GitHub. 

The page is hosted using GitHub Pages by doing the following:

1) Log in
2) Open Repo
3) Select Settings
4) Find the GitHub Pages Section
5) select the master branch as the source
6) get link from the page again.

This page can be found [here](https://EonTas.github.io/Mods-Site/.) for the forseeable future.

## How to run locally

To clone you will need a github account or other git client.
1) Open this link to the [project](https://github.com/EonTAS/Mods-Site/)
2) Under the repo name, click "clone or download" button.
3) copy the clone url for the repository.
4) In your IDE of choice, open the terminal 
5) set working directory to where you want to clone the repo.
6) type `git clone` and paste the url from step 3 and press enter.

### Testing

- W3C CSS Validation

# Lighthouse: 
Lighthouse test results for each page are as follows: 

## Home Page
![home](testing/lighthouse/home.png)
## Features Page
![features](testing/lighthouse/features.png)
## Report Page
![report](testing/lighthouse/report.png)

# Others:

## Page Scaling:

All pages correctly change appearance according to page size. Mostly vertically aligned content in small sizes, changing to elements in the same row with different text alignment at larger scales.

## Navbar: 

- Expected: 

Logo resizes at same time dropdown dissapears to be make large screen sizes look better

Opened page at different scales.

# Credits: 

To make the youtube video correctly use a 16:9 aspect ratio, I used the css found here: https://css-tricks.com/fluid-width-video/ 

To make the carousel of images work appropriately, the example code found [here](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/carousel/) in the documentation was used extensively.

The video featured on the home page is not mine, it is just relevant to the topic of the site since i don't have an actual vidoe to place there. The video belongs to the SmashAcademy youtube channel.
